# "ignoreip" can be an IP address, a CIDR mask or a DNS host. Fail2ban will not
# ban a host which matches an address in this list. Several addresses can be
# defined using space separator.

# This will ignore connection coming from common private networks.
# Note that local connections can come from other than just 127.0.0.1, so
# this needs CIDR range too.
